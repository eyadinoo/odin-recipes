        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, and pour in milk, oil, and egg. Mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side.
